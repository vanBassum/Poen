# Poen

Poen is a console application designed to track the value of your wallet over time.

NOTE: This is just a small thing for me to mess around with, feel free to use for whatever, just know its not production ready.

## Features

- Fetches transaction data from Ethereum (via Etherscan API) and Binance Smart Chain (via Bscscan API).
- Calculates token balances and their USD equivalents.
- Retrieves conversion rates from CoinMarketCap and other providers.
- Displays token balances and transaction details in the console.
